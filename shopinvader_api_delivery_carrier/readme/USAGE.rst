This module will give you several endpoints for interacting with delivery carrier.
You can play with it with swagger.

This module provides the following routers:
* ``delivery_carrier_router`` to get the carriers available for a partner;
* ``delivery_carrier_cart_router`` to get the carriers available for a cart, including delivery prices for the cart, and set a carrier on a cart;
* ``delivery_router``: to search on all deliveries linked to the authenticated partner.
