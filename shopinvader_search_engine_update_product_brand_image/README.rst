This module extends the functionality of the
``shopinvader_search_engine_update`` and
``shopinvader_search_engine_product_brand_image`` modules to mark the
information exported to the search engine as to be recomputed when the
images of a product brand are updated.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Use Cases / Context
===================

When you update the image associated to a product brand and this
information is exposed by the search engine on the product and or on a
product brand index, you expect to see your changes applied into the
