When exporting a reference to a media into your search engine, you can choose
on the search engine backend from where the media will be available.
(Odoo or External  file system)

To make your media stored outside of Odoo, you need to add and/or configure
a file system storage backend provided by the module fs_storage_ to be used to
store files defined on the *Product Media* model.
