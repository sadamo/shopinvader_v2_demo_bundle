- Allows to configure the strategy to apply to generate the url for a given media
  from the search engine backend form view. The field was declared on the model
  but not displayed on the form. This change adds the field to the form view. (`#1518 <https://github.com/shopinvader/odoo-shopinvader/issues/1518>`_)
