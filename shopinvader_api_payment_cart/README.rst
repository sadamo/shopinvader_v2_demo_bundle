This addon adds logic to payments, specifically concerning the sale orders.
It defines a callback on payment transactions, in order to confirm the cart
(making it a quotation) when the payment is done.
What's more, it adds a configuration on the payment provider to decide if,
when the payment is done, the quotation must stay a quotation or be confirmed
into a sale order.

Usage
=====

**Get the encoded payable info for a cart**

As the routes on the cart router are private, the user needs to be authenticated to retrieve the cart payable info.
Call one of the routes `/current/payable/` or `/{uuid}/payable` to retrieve the payable token that will be needed in all public payment routes of the `shopinvader_api_payment` core addon.
