This addons provides 2 new routers: `loyalty_router` and 
`sale_loyalty_cart_router`. The `sale_loyalty_cart_router` is declared
with the same tags as the one defined in the `shopinvader_api_cart`
addon. As this one, no prefix is added to the router, to allow to mount
it as a nested app. See the README of `shopinvader_api_cart` for
more details on how to do it.

As all api addons, installing this addon will not have any effect on the
existing fastapi app. You must add the routers to the app by yourself by
editing your fastapi.endpoint where you want to add the routes.
