Prevent MRO conflicts when the module is installed at same time as the
shopinvader_search_engine module. By inheriting from the same *se.indexable.record*
model, the MRO conflict is avoided. Before this commit we ended up with a
redefinition of the *product.product* model to inherit from a subclass of
*se.indexable.record* in the *sale_channel_search_engine_product* module and
a redefinition of the *product.product* model to inherit from the *se.indexable.record*
model in the *shopinvader_search_engine* module. This situation was causing
a MRO conflict.
