16.0.1.0.0 (2023-10-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rename module shopinvader_product_stock -> shopinvader_search_engine_product_stock
- Refactoring to fit the refactoring of shopinvader_search_engine

For now exclusively made to work with shopinvader_search_engine. If you need to use
another way of exporting bindings, you'll need a place to configure warehouse, product
stock field, etc. and you'll need to extract part of the code of this module.
