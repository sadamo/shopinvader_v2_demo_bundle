"* By default, an internal url can be used to access the image through the\n"
"    Odoo server.\n"
"* On a fs.storage backend, you can also specifiy a base url to access the\n"
"    image directly through the storage server. This is useful to avoid\n"

"* `Relative path URL`: the URL will be the relative path of the image\n"

"In the last case, you must take care of adding the CDN URL on your frontend to\n"
